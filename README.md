# GlideinWMS contributed software

This repository collects software and documentation that is not yet part of GlideinWMS or GlideinMonitor.

Please create your subdirectory with your project and add everything underneath that.
A recommended structure is to have src and doc subdirectories within each project, containing
respectively the code and the documentation (possibly in ReStructured Text or MarkDown formats). 
A README.md file, setup other auxiliary scripts can be in the root directory of the project. 
The main root directory includes the Fermilab BSD-style license, LICENSE.txt. Projects may add a 
different license in their subdirectory, otherwise this will be assumend as default license.
One line added to the following list will help identify your project.
