# GlideinWMS contributed software

This repository collects software and documentation not yet included in GlideinWMS
or other bigger projects like GlideinMonitor and GlideinBenchmark.

Please create your subdirectory with your project and add everything underneath that.
A recommended structure is to have src and doc subdirectories within each project, containing
respectively the code and the documentation (possibly in ReStructured Text or MarkDown formats). 
A README.md file, setup, and other auxiliary scripts can be in the root directory of the project. 
This main root directory includes the Apache-2.0 license, LICENSE.txt. Projects may add a 
different license in their subdirectory, otherwise, this will be assumed as the default Apache-2.0 license, 
as Copyright 2021 Fermi Research Alliance, LLC.

One line added to the following list will help identify your project.

Projects:
* _example\_ : example project
* AIforJobSiteAllocation: artificial intelligence for solving the problem of the job/site allocation.
* GWMSTestingApplication: HEP skimming on supercomputers
